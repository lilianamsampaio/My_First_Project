        <h2>Tattoology: Who Came Up With It?</h2>
        <p>
          Funny story, three guys walk into a bar...
          Just kidding, but it did happen in a bar! Our very own John Doe was catching up with Jane Smith and one conversation lead to another until finally they were commenting on how there are no legit tattoo parlers in the area. Jane said " Let's F*ing do it!"

      <h3>Why tattoology?</h3>
      <p>
        Look, I'm not gonna say we're the best in the world - we admire and love our fellow artists and only want the best of the best for them. But I can say that we are pretty damn close. Are artists are one of kind, specilized artists and live, breath, sleep tattos.
